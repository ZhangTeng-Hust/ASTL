## Description

### Calibration
The theta.xlsx file holds the values from joint 1 to joint 6 in columns


Each column of the Leica.csv file represents the coordinates of x, y and z respectively; Overall measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in x, y and z directions, elevation Angle of the laser tracker, quaternion, image RMS, reflection equipment information, temperature, pressure, humidity at the time of measurement, time stamp, whether leveling is used.


In total, there are 40 spatial points.
