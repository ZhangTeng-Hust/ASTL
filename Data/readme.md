## Description

### Calibration
The theta.xlsx file holds the values from joint 1 to joint 6 in columns

Each column of the Leica.csv file represents the coordinates of x, y and z respectively; Overall measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in x, y and z directions, elevation Angle of the laser tracker, quaternion, image RMS, reflection equipment information, temperature, pressure, humidity at the time of measurement, time stamp, whether leveling is used.

In total, there are 40 spatial points.

### POINTS
The theta.xlsx file holds the values from joint 1 to joint 6 in columns

Each column of the Leica.csv file represents the coordinates of x, y and z respectively; Overall measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in x, y and z directions, elevation Angle of the laser tracker, quaternion, image RMS, reflection equipment information, temperature, pressure, humidity at the time of measurement, time stamp, whether leveling is used.

In total, there are 300 spatial points.

### LINE
The theta.xlsx file holds the values from joint 1 to joint 6 in columns

Each column of the Leica.csv file represents the coordinates of x, y and z respectively; Overall measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in x, y and z directions, elevation Angle of the laser tracker, quaternion, image RMS, reflection equipment information, temperature, pressure, humidity at the time of measurement, time stamp, whether leveling is used.

In total, there are 300 spatial points.

### CURVE
The theta.xlsx file holds the values from joint 1 to joint 6 in columns

Each column of the Leica.csv file represents the coordinates of x, y and z respectively; Overall measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in x, y and z directions, elevation Angle of the laser tracker, quaternion, image RMS, reflection equipment information, temperature, pressure, humidity at the time of measurement, time stamp, whether leveling is used.

In total, there are 500 spatial points.

### SURFACE
The theta.xlsx file holds the values from joint 1 to joint 6 in columns

Each column of the Leica.csv file represents the coordinates of x, y and z respectively; Overall measurement uncertainty, uncertainty in x, y and z directions, elevation Angle of the laser tracker, quaternion, image RMS, reflection equipment information, temperature, pressure, humidity at the time of measurement, time stamp, whether leveling is used.

In total, there are 2500 spatial points.

### Tasks Constructed
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the prediction and compensation of pose error, four robot motion tasks were constructed, defined as POINTS, LINE, CURVE and SURFACE, as follows.
