### Results
- 1.The robot pose error prediction is defined as a transfer learning paradigm for the first time.Measurement-based and calibration-based methods for pose error perception are focused on with a new perspective.
- 2.The multi-stage greedy sampling (MGS)strategy is proposed to achieve informed selection and measurement of a few samples.The semi-supervised transfer learning (STL)is proposed to achieve the transfer of domain knowledge in the form of model,data and loss function from the simulation domain to the measurement domain.
- 3.An active semi-supervised transfer learning method (ASTL)for robot pose error prediction is proposed integrating the MGS and the STL,which achieve efficient and accurate prediction of robot pose error.
